                <h2>Katelyn Brown</h2>
                <p>I am a first generation college student attending Lewis & Clark State College earning my associates in Web Design and Development with plans to get started on a batchlors in Software Engineering in the fall of 2024. 
                    I graduated Capital highschool in 2022, and since then have been working to pay for college myself.</p>
                <p>Programming has always been something I've been interested in, but my schools didn't provide the best classes for learning 
                    how to actually program/read and write code, so I started off having to teach myself until I was enrolled at college and could be 
                    properly taught various things properly, like HTML, CSS, Python, JS, etc, and it has been a wonderful experience so far. 
                </p>
